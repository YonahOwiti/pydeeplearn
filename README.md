In this project, we applied Convolution Neural Networks to predict emotions from the image of human faces. We used Kaggle Facial Emotion Recognition 2013 [11] dataset for training. The human accuracy on this dataset is 65%. We experimented with different models and hyper parameters to finally come up with a model that meets the human accuracy. Our best performing model also performs in the range of the top 4 models of the challenge. Further, we applied different visualisation techniques on this model.

Borrowed the webcam live video capture from the Pydeeplearn repository

Added support for training CNNs to recognize facial expressions using Keras Deep Learning library
